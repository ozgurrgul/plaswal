This is an experimental (for now) crypto wallet extension I am developing. Currently it supports following assets:

- Ethereum ERC20 tokens
- Solana
- Solana SPL tokens

It has the features for:

- Very WIP onboarding flow
- Get balance for ETH/SOL/SPL
- Receive crypto
- Send crypto for ETH/ERC20/SOL

Soon:

- Transaction fee overriding
- Token management
- Swapping
